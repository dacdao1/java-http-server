# Creating a server with Java

I used the package, server socket, to create a web server that will listen into localhost 8080. This will create a personal server for your personal environment. This will help let you see your Java output on the web browser when you go onto http://localhost:8080/ .

Below is the Java output when I run the command

```java
java HTTPserverCreated
```

Below will be the output on the browser that is currently on the link http://localhost:8080/.
